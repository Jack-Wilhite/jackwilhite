<h1>This is a call for help</h1>
<p>Phishing is the act of sending emails that appear to be from a reputable company in order to trick people into revealing personal information. Flaming is the act of insulting or acting hostile towards someone over the internet. Spamming is when someone indiscriminately send the same message to large amount of people on the internet. All three actions are both common on the internet and pretty annoying. The differences between them are that spamming is primarily done to make money based on who actually responds. Phishing is used to steal and prey on people who may not know any better. Flaming is just some loser thinking they might accomplish by attacking someone over the internet.  </p>
